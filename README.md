# Employee-Absenteeism-Analysis

<b>Purpose:<b> To explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.<br>

In other words:
<br>
We would like to know how many working hours the employee would be away from work based on the information such as,<br>

• How far do they live from the workspace?<br>
• How many children and pets do they have?<br>
• Do they have higher education? And so on.<br><br>
Steps in which we will do the project:<br>

1. <b>Data Preprocessing:<b> I started working on the dataset ‘Absenteeism_data.csv’’ in Jupyter Notebook and make it usable for the machine learning algorithm.<br>
2. <b>Machine Learning:<b> In this section, I developed a logistic regression model that will predict the probability of an individual being absent from work. The Python module which results from this work will be used for further analysis.<br>
3. Loading module from the previous operation and integrating Python and SQL: Here I loaded the module to generate predictions. Further, I integrated Jupyter Notebook with MySQL workbench to show how Python and SQL can be connected. The dataset obtained from this will be used for further analysis and visualization.<br>
4. Analyzing predicted outputs in Tableau: At last, I used Tableau to analyze three separate dependencies between inputs and the model obtained.<br>
